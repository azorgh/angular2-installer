How to use
===================

Requirements :
- Composer
- NodeJS

First, download the Angular installer using Composer:
```
$ composer global require pallmallshow/angular2-installer:@dev
```

Make sure to place the *~/.composer/vendor/bin* directory in your PATH so the *angular* executable can be located by your system.

Then, you can run everywere :

```
$ angular create myApp
```

A new folder 'myApp' was created, and a default project was generated with their dependencies.

To launch your new app after angular-installer, simply run `$ npm start ` in your app folder.

Versions
-------------
For the moment, this is a dev version.
After some execution and feedback, we could release a stable version maybe with some improvements.
